# Assistive Wearable for the Blind and the Visually Impaired

The aim of this project is to provide the blind/visually impaired community with technology that would enable them to become less reliable on others. In this particular project, we are focusing on the possibility of eliminating the walking stick. As an addition, we are also focusing on facial recognition wherein the user will be able to identify people known to him.
