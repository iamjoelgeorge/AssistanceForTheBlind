the following packages need to be installed for this program to run

1.gtts
2.mpg321 or mpg123, whichever works. It should be reflected in the program
feel free to use some other media player, the problem with all the other players i tried was that they open a video prompt along with the audio and they wouldn't close automatically.

"sudo" was necessary where the media player is being called in the program otherwise it would show an error in my system, feel free to experiment with that

for any additional queries contact the author
